I am a second-year PhD candidate in computational neuroscience ðŸ§  at the [Mathis lab of Adaptive Intelligence](http://www.mackenziemathislab.org/) (PI Prof. Mackenzie Mathis) as part of the [ELLIS PhD program](https://ellis.eu/) and EDEE PhD program in EPFL. I work on understanding how the brain integrates external features in its environment and constructs neural representations models to generalize and extract the relevant information from it ðŸ§©. I have a strong interest in investigating the dynamics ðŸ’« taking place during the formation of such neural representations while learning and performing a task. To do so, I will relate vision ðŸ‘€ and movements ðŸ’ª by exploring the processes at play in active sensing.
