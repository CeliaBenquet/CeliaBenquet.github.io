I am a PhD student at the Mathis lab of Adaptive Motor Control (PI Prof. Mackenzie Mathis). I work on understanding how the brain represents external features in its environment and constructs internal models to generalize and extract the relevant information from it. I have a strong interest in investigating the dynamics taking place during the formation of such internal representation while learning a task. To do so, I will relate motor control and vision by exploring the processes at play in active sensing. 

More generally, I'm fascinated with how neurosciences and computer sciences are interlaced, each of those fields needing the other to progress. More specifically, with the development of powerful recording tools such as Neuropixels, I believe that the challenges of the field are now to develop the appropriate computational methods to find structure in the data, using existing and adapted mathematical theories from topological algebra to dynamical systems.
