I am a first-year PhD student in computational neuroscience ðŸ§  at the [Mathis lab of Adaptive Motor Control](http://www.mackenziemathislab.org/) (PI Prof. Mackenzie Mathis) as part of the [ELLIS PhD program](https://ellis.eu/). I work on understanding how the brain represents external features in its environment and constructs internal models to generalize and extract the relevant information from it ðŸ§©. I have a strong interest in investigating the dynamics ðŸ’« taking place during the formation of such internal representation while learning a task. To do so, I will relate motor control ðŸ’ªand vision ðŸ‘€ by exploring the processes at play in active sensing. 

More generally, with the development of powerful recording tools ðŸ“¡ such as Neuropixels, neuroscientists can find relevant structure in the data, at the neural population level. I am interested in bringing the appropriate computational and mathematical methods to the field, by adapting theories from topological algebra, graphs or dynamical systems.
